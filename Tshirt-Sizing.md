# T-Shirt Sizing for Tech Projects

## Overview
T-Shirt sizing is an agile estimation technique that uses relative sizes (XS-XXL) to estimate project effort, complexity, and scope.

## Size Definitions

| Size | Effort Level | Time Estimate | Complexity | Team Involvement | Example Work Items |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **XS** | Very small  | <0.5 week     | Trivial    | Individual       | Minor bug fixes, text changes, config updates |
| **S**  | Small       | 1-2 weeks     | Simple     | Individual       | Small features, simple UI changes |
| **M**  | Medium      | 3-4 weeks     | Moderate   | 1-2 people       | Medium features, system integrations |
| **L**  | Large       | 5-6 weeks     | Complex    | Small team (2-3) | Complex features, new microservices |
| **XL** | Very large  | 7-8 weeks    | High       | Cross-team       | Major functionality, architectural changes |
| **XXL**| Epic        | 8-12 weeks   | Very high  | Multiple teams   | Multi-component projects |

## Estimation Guidelines

### Factors to Consider:
- 🔹 **Complexity**: Technical difficulty and unknowns
- 🔹 **Effort**: Person-hours required
- 🔹 **Dependencies**: Internal/external systems involved
- 🔹 **Risk**: Uncertainty level
- 🔹 **Scope**: Breadth of work required

### Best Practices:
✅ Use historical data for calibration  
✅ Break XXL items into smaller pieces  
✅ Re-evaluate as more information emerges  
✅ Include all phases (dev, test, deploy) in estimates  
✅ Maintain team-specific sizing standards
